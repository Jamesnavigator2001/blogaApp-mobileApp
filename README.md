# BlogApp Mobile Application

**BlogApp** is a mobile application built in Java that allows users to browse, create, and interact with blog posts. It connects to a Django backend via a REST API, enabling seamless data synchronization and user authentication. Perfect for bloggers who want a clean, intuitive mobile experience!

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the BlogApp on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Backend Setup**: Ensure the [Django Blog API](https://github.com/your-django-backend-repo) is set up and running.  
- **Android Studio**: Install Android Studio (latest version) for building the mobile app.  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.  
- **API Base URL**: Update the mobile app with your Django backend URL (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Backend)
Add these to your Django `.env` file:
```python
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost, 127.0.0.1
```

### CORS Setup (Backend)
Ensure your Django backend allows requests from the mobile app by configuring `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `settings.py`:
```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
    "http://10.0.2.2:8000",  # Android emulator
]
```
